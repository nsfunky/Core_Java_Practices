	when i write any interface without any member then that interface is termed as marker interface.
    
	marker interface is used to define the eligibility of the class.
	
	there are some marker interface, provided by SUN
	
	1) Serializable interface
	2) RandomAccess interface
	3) Cloneable interface
	
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	
	you can also write marker interface, but with the use of reflection mechanism,
	you need to write the processing of custom marker interface.
